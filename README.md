# FYP_Remote_Sensing_Demonstration_USING_EV3
Final Year Project
In this project the ultrasonic sensor would be equipped to the EV3 robot and they will be used to create and display the maps of the robots 
surroundings to a user. The robot can be contacted remotely using Bluetooth or WiFi which will allow the information from sensors to be 
transmitted back to a second computer for display. In a more developed case, the user should be able to control the robot remotely. The 
ultrasonic mapping will be an essential part for this project. The project will involve using the leJOS java based operating system for 
LEGO robots. It will involve using leJOSs support for remote operation of a robot using Bluetooth or WiFi. Java is the develop language for 
the project and the leJOS EV3 API would be used in this project. Investigation of the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) 
algorithms will help update the maps more accurately. This project is my final year project in University of Liverpool.
